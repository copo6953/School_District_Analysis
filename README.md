# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
* The purpose of this project is to help Maria, the chief data scientist for the city school district, analyze data on student funding and student standardized test scores. The data was adjusted due to 9th grade scores being inaccurately reported. The analysis for this project was done using the Pandas Python library on Jupyter Notebook.
### Results
* The removal of 9th grade scores from Thomas high school decreased the district overall passing percantage by 1%.
